\maketitle

Once upon a time, deep in the prairies of the Midwest, a farmer named Snedecor planted a new kind of seed. The seeds were dispersed randomly through 3.141593 acres of rich brown Iowan soil. A tiny grey bird, with a bright red spot on both wings, was watching ever so closely  from the stalk of a tall grass close by. The farmer surveyed his spread of seeds, and used his rake to dust  over a covering layer. The sun cast a golden gleam over the field, a contrast against the brilliant blue sky, as the farmer strode away, happy with his work. In darted the grey bird. She landed on a black sod, and proceeded to hop a straight line through the field, sifting the top layer of dirt, eating the seeds. Three perfectly straight lines devoid of seeds resulted. 

The next day, Snedecor convinced his good friend R.A. Fisher to help him estimate the effects of the grey birds actions on his expected harvest. After a careful examination of Snedecor's method of seed dispersion, Fisher reached the conclusion that the seeds were not randomly distributed through the soil. Thus, Fisher had the misfortune of explaining to his friend that any estimation of these effects would be biased. Unhappy with the turn of events, Snedecor swallowed hard and invited his friend inside for some tea and crumpets.

The secretary of Snedecor  noticed both of them getting in having their minds occupied with some complex thoughts. She knew Snedecor very well. But it was this strange R. A. Fisher about whom she did not have much of understanding. Whenever he travelled to this prairies, Snedecor became excited with his various experiments. But today was different, they were not talking to each other. Snedecor prepared tea for both of them and sat on his working table while R. A. Fisher was glaring at the vapor curling from the hot tea. At some point, Fisher told something to Snedecor and both of them rushed out of the room. She knew, none of them had a chance to get a sip from the tea cup before they potentially reached another solution of their disturbing problem. She was 95\% confident that this apparent solution would turn out to be flawed again. 

But his secretary did not know that it was different this time.
