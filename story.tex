\maketitle

Once upon a time, deep in the prairies of the Midwest, a farmer named Snedecor planted a new kind of seed. The seeds were dispersed randomly through 3.141593 acres of rich brown Iowan soil. A tiny grey bird, with a bright red spot on both wings, was watching ever so closely from the stalk of a tall grass close by. The farmer surveyed his spread of seeds, and used his rake to dust over a covering layer. The sun cast a golden gleam over the field, a contrast against the brilliant blue sky, as the farmer strode away, happy with his work. In darted the grey bird. She landed on a black sod, and proceeded to hop a straight line through the field, sifting the top layer of dirt, eating the seeds. Three perfectly straight lines devoid of seeds resulted. 

The next day, Snedecor convinced his good friend R.A. Fisher to help him estimate the effects of the grey birds actions on his expected harvest. After a careful examination of Snedecor's method of seed dispersion, Fisher reached the conclusion that the seeds were not randomly distributed through the soil. Thus, Fisher had the misfortune of explaining to his friend that any estimation of these effects would be biased. Unhappy with the turn of events, Snedecor swallowed hard and invited his friend inside for some tea and crumpets.

The secretary of Snedecor noticed both of them getting in having their minds occupied with some complex thoughts. She knew Snedecor very well. But it was this strange R. A. Fisher about whom she did not have much of understanding. Whenever he travelled to this prairies, Snedecor became excited with his various experiments. But today was different, they were not talking to each other. Snedecor prepared tea for both of them and sat on his working table while R. A. Fisher was glaring at the vapor curling from the hot tea. At some point, Fisher told something to Snedecor and both of them rushed out of the room. She knew, none of them had a chance to get a sip from the tea cup before they potentially reached another solution of their disturbing problem. She was 95\% confident that this apparent solution would turn out to be flawed again. 

But his secretary did not know that it was different this time.\\

``I'm sorry I rushed us out of the room so quickly but this just arrived'' said Fisher. 

``What is it?'' Snedecor promptly inquired.

``A note that I think you'll find to be most illuminating'' was Fisher's response before displaying the following to his dashing colleague.

Snedecor didn't understand.  He wondered silently to himself about who this ``Evil Zombie Lincoln'' could be and if he really was an evil undead version of one of the country's greatest Presidents.  Gazing over to his friend Fisher he could see by the look in his eyes that not only did he know of this ``Evil Zombie Lincoln'' but that he has had past dealings with him as well.

Fisher started running and shouted back to his friend ``We need to go see Sir Reverend Bayes as soon as possible.  Not that I'm looking forward to it... The last time I was in a room with him he cut off my right hand.''

As only the uberest of Mensches have done, the Reverend had long since retired to the floating island of Laputa, the existence of which Jonathan Swift only suspected when he wrote, \underline{Gulliver's Travels}. As Fisher related this secret to Snedecor, they both puzzled over some important practical issues. How would they find the island? How would they breathe once they arrived? After all, the island was currently somewhere in the mesosphere. \newline

The Jackal, eavesdropping, said, ``Not to worry. Laputa has its own atmosphere, which feels like the lower troposphere.'' \newline

This strange creature's sudden appearance prompted several questions for Snedecor, who immediately voiced his most urgent concern: ``Are you going to eat me?'' \newline

``No.'' proudly boomed the Jackal. ``I am a Jackal, and therefore I eat bricks.'' \newline

The Jackal proceeded to eat a lone brick that was concealing the bird who had earlier eaten the seeds. After he finished, the wondrous extraneous masonry cleaner-upper pointed a deft paw at the feathered rogue and declared, ``You, sir, are a beanstalk.'' \newline

With a cry of jubilance, glee, passion, enlightenment, morality, inquiry-based learning, and shrill inflections (for it was the bird's lifelong ambition to become some sort of tall leafy thing), the bird poofed into a beanstalk and grew at an alarming rate, rocketing the two men and the fabulous fanged demigod up into the clouds. \newline

With the Central Limit Theorem in captivity, things were no longer as they once seemed. As the Jackal explained on their way up through the clouds, without the Central Limit Theorem to benevolently govern us, the Bayes Estimator always takes the form of a beanstalk. That's why the best way to find The Eternal Reverand Bayes is to hop on a beanstalk and wait five minutes. Because although riding a fast-growing beanstalk is extremely risky (you could fall off and die), the Bayes Risk of this undertaking is extremely small because:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 99.99\% of all beanstalks eventually find their way to Bayes
\item Bayes is an Ubermensch and safe in the clouds, so beanstalks pose a minimal threat to his well-being.
\end{enumerate}
As the Jackal explained all this, Snedecor and Fisher furiously scribbled down notes, particularly the warning that a low-Bayes-Risk undertaking can still be very risky.

Meanwhile, Snedecor's secretary, Marge chuckled to herself as she watched Snedecor and his troublesome friend be whisked into the air by a beanstalk. Grabbing a very large teacup, Marge poured herself the entire pot of tea Snedecor had been brewing and whipped out her cell phone. 

``Yes. Mhmm. Of course. Do you know who I am!'' she exclaimed into the phone. 

``These people are ridiculous'' she muttered under her breath. 

``Abe, darling, how are you? ''

``They are on their way to the Reverend. However they do have the jackal with them'' she reported.

``oh dear, ''

After 2.718282 days on the beanstalk, Snedecor and Fisher eventually arrived at the island of Laputa. 
``Where is Sir Reverend Bayes? The expected life time of such a beanstalk is 3.14 days, 
and I don't want to stay here for the rest of my life.'' Snedecor asked the jackal.

``My dear friends, look, there are three cloud caves, Mr. Bayes is in one of them.'' Answered the jackal proudly,
``Let's make a deal. You choose one cave, then I will tell you another cave which Mr. Bayes is not in.
You can stay with or switch your choice. Deal or not deal?''

``Alright. The left one.'' Said Fisher.

``Well, he is not in the middle cave. Stay or change?'' Said the jackal.

Then Fisher had to start his first Bayesian problem.
