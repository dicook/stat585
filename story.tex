A tiny grey bird with a bright red spot was watching ever so closely  from the stalk of a tall grass close by. The farmer surveyed his spread of seeds, and used his rake to dust  over a covering layer. The sun cast a golden gleam over the field, contrasting the brilliant blue sky, as the farmer strode away happy with his work. In darted the grey bird.
