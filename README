This repository is put together to help Statistics 585 students learn how to use git, to coordinate group work on coding and technical writing. Students need to

(1) check out story.tex, 

(2) add a paragraph, wherever they see a place that could do with an extension or a segue, 

(3) latex it to check that the file can be successfully typeset, and

(4) check their changes back in.
